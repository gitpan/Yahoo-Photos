Yahoo-Photos version 0.0.1

With this module, you can manage your albums on Yahoo Photos
(<http://photos.yahoo.com/>). Currently creating and deleting
albums and uploading photos is implemented.

The distribution also ships with a handy wrapper script
for simple uploading from the shell.


INSTALLATION

The generic Module::Build installation instructions work.
To install system-wide:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  sudo ./Build install

To install in a private directory:

  perl Build.PL --install_base ~/perl
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install

Do not forget to add $HOME/perl/lib/perl5 to your @INC.
See the PERL5LIB environment variable in perldoc perlrun,
the -I command line switch in perldoc perlrun
or the lib pragma in perldoc lib.


DEPENDENCIES

* For running:
perl-5.8
YAML
Readonly
HTTP::Cookies::Netscape
WWW::Mechanize
File::HomeDir
Class::Spiffy
Perl::Version

TESTING

Without special preparation, some tests are skipped.
If you want to go to the bother to run everything,
you need to have a valid Yahoo login and set it up
in a credentials file in the following location:

perl -Ilib -MYahoo::Photos -e'print Yahoo::Photos->credfile'

It is a YAML file and looks like this:
---
user: SUPERHAPPYFUNUSER
pass: SUPERHAPPYFUNPASS

Additionally, provide a photo named Camel_berlin_2004.jpg
suitable for uploading in the same directory. Download from
<http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Camel_berlin_2004.jpg>

There are some checks provided through Test::Pod::Coverage and
Test::Pod if they can be loaded.

There is also a test through Test::Perl::Critic,
enabled by setting the TEST_AUTHOR env variable.
It is not useful for other people than me, the author.
